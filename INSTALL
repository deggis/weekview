INSTALLATION:

WEEKVIEW is a Django application, so as a home it needs a Django project.
Installing this to Django site from scratch can be done like this:

0. Get Django ( http://www.djangoproject.com/ ) to your healthy, Python enabled
   environment.

1. django-admin.py startproject [mysite]
    * This creates [mysite] folder + Django stuff.

2. Put weekview under [mysite] folder.

3. Edit your [mysite]/settings.py
    * Fix database settings
    * Add '[mysite].weekview' to INSTALLED_APPS

4. Edit then [mysite]/urls.py
    * Add redirects for Weekview application:
        (r'^weekview/', include('[mysite].weekview.urls')),
    * Add simple login processor:
        (r'^accounts/login/$', 'django.contrib.auth.views.login'),

5. At [mysite] run 'python manage.py syncdb'

That's it.




Troubleshooting:

 * If Django complains about attribute error on django.root,
   add "import django; django.root = ''" or other relative path
   to your Django project instance, i.e. "/django"

--

Test server for trying out the site can be launched at [mysite] with
'python manage.py runserver'. Point your browser to
    http://test-server-address[:port]/weekview/
